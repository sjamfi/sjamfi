                <p class="mbr-text align-center pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">St. John Academy of Manila Foundation Incorporated was conceived through the vision of one man, Mr. Jose A. Lising, founder, owner and the first president, who has always believed that quality education is the best gift that parents can give to their children. Fuelled by a desire to make this education accessible and affordable even to the average income families in Tondo and its surounding districts, Mr. Jose Lising together with his associate they met and started mapping out plans to make this vision a reality.<br><br>An old, three-storey building at 725 Bulacan Street, Gagalangin, Tondo, Manila was chosen as the site for the would be school. The building was first used by a public school, the Librada Elementary School, then, as a garment factory. After the last lease eded, the building was vacated and left unattended for several years. Due to many years of neglect, the job of renovating the building was a both gigantic and expensive task for Mr. lising and his associates. Nevertheless, spiraliling expenses notwithstanding, everything needed to make the school building and its facilisties safe, functional, and coducive to the teaching-learning process was done with determination and much faith.<br><br>Preparing the school building and its facilities was one o the many tasks attended to by the school administrators. The recruitment and training of the faculty, the formulation of the curriculum, the acquisition of instructional equipment and materials, and the promotion work to attract the first students of the school kept the management staff busy prior to the opening of the academy for the School Year 2002-2003.<br><br>Mrs. Annabelle M. Sanchez, the first academic consultant of the school, assisted the management in planning the curriculum.<br><br>On June 17, 2002, St. John Academy of Manila Foundation Incorporated opened its doors to its batch of 119 students from Pre-school to Second Year High School, with 7 members of the faculty. Mrs. Theresa Pili-Nisperos served as acting principal, Mrs. Eulalia L. Morales as administrative officer, and Mr. Emilio S. Morales as vice president.<br><br>Mr. Ernesto S.D. Garcia was elected as the first president of SJAMFI Parent-Teach Association.<br><br>The renovated three-storey building boused air-conditioned classrooms, special rooms and offices, the Computer Laboratory, the Library, the Science Laboratory, the canteen, and the mini kitchen for the HELE/T.L.E. Laboratory.<br><br>In School Year 2003-2004, the enrolment rose to 166 and the members of the faculty to 12. Mr. Morales was designated vice-president for operations and Mrs. Morales was vice president for finance. Mrs. Teresita L. Dayoja took over as the principal of the school. Pastor Elgie Arthur T. Tamon II was designated as chaplain and guidance counsellor.<br><br>In School Year 2004-2005, the Department of Education NCR, granted recognition to the pre-school and elementary school departments. The enrollment rose up to 195. Two more teachers were added to the faculty. The High School opened its third year class. The classrooms were renovated to make them bigger, a bigger laboratory was provided for the HELE/T.L.E. classes and all classrooms were provided with at least two bulletin boards. Twice a month, the high school students used the nearby Gapan Basketball Court for their physical education activities. The school held its Araw ng Parangal 2004-2005 and its 2nd and 3rd Commencement Exercises at the Lord is My Shepherd Fellowship Hall at Juan Luna Street, Tondo, Manila.<br><br>During its 3rd Commencement Exercises the school graduated its first Valedictorian, Janice D.G. Roman, member of the Grade School Class 2005.</p>
