                    <br>OUR STORY</h1>
                
                <p class="mbr-text align-center pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">HISTORY OF ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST ACADEMY OF MANILA<br><br>St. John the Baptist Academy of Manila was conceived through the vision of one man, Mr. Jose A. Lising, founder, owner and the first president, who has always believed that quality education is the best gift that parents can give to their children. Fueled by a desire to make this education accessible and affordable, even to the average-income families in Tondo and its surrounding districts. Mr. Jose Lising, together with his associates started mapping out plans to make this vision a reality.<br><br>An old, three-story building at 725 Bulacan Street, Gagalangin, Tondo, Manila was chosen as the site for the would-be school. The building was first used by the Librada Elementary School, then, as a garment factory. After the last lease ended, the building was vacated and left unattended for several years. Due to the many years of neglect, the job of renovating the building was both a gigantic and expensive task for Mr. Lising and his associates. Nevertheless, spiraling expenses notwithstanding, everything needed to make the school building and its facilities safe, functional, and conducive to the teaching-learning process was done with determination and much faith.<br><br>Preparing the school building and its facilities were one of the many tasks attended by the school administrators. The recruitment and training of the faculty, formulation of the curriculum, acquisition of instructional equipment and materials, and the promotional work to attract the first students of the school kept the management staff busy before the opening of the academy for School Year 2002-2003.<br><br>Mrs. Annabelle M. Sanchez, the first academic consultant of the school, assisted the management in planning the curriculum.<br>On June 17, 2002, St. John the Baptist Academy of Manila opened its doors to its batch of 119 For students from Pre-School to Second Year High School, with 7 members of the faculty. Mrs. Theresa Pili- Nisperos served as acting principal for the first year of school operation. Mrs. Eulalia L. Morales as an administrative officer, Mr. Emilio S. Morales, as vice president.<br><br>Mr. Ernesto S.D. Garcia was elected as the first president of the SJBAM Parent-Teachers Association.<br><br>The renovated three-story building housed air-conditioned classrooms, special rooms and officers, the Computer Laboratory, Library, Science Laboratory, Canteen, and the Mini kitchen for the HELE/THE Laboratory.<br><br>In School Year 2003-2004, the enrollment rose to 166 and the members of the faculty to 12. Mr. Morales was designated as vice-president for operations and Mrs. Morales as vice-president for finance, Mr. Jose G. Laoingco replaced Mrs. Theresa Pili- Nisperos as the acting principal for four (4) consecutive school years. Mrs. Teresita L. Dayoja took over as the principal of the school in school year 2007 to present. Pastor Elgie Arthur T. Tamon II was designated as a chaplain and guidance counselor and resigned in 2006.<br><br>In School Year 2004-2005, the Department of Education NCR granted recognition to the preschool and elementary school departments. The enrollment rose to 195. Two more teachers were added to the faculty. The High School department opened its third-year class. The classrooms were renovated to make them bigger. A bigger laboratory was provided for the HELE/THE classes and all classrooms were installed one (1) air conditioning unit and provided with at least two bulletin boards and blackboards. Twice a month, the high school students used the nearby Gapan Basketball Court for their physical education activities. Institutional activities are also held in this said basketball court. The school held its Araw ng Parangal 2004-2005 and its 2nd and 3rd Commencement Exercises at the Lord is my Shepherd Fellowship Hall at Juan Luna Street, Tondo, Manila.<br>Thereafter, succeeding Commencement Rites and First Communion Ceremonies are held in the Abbot Lopez Hall of San Beda University and the Our Lady of Monseratte Church of the same school.<br><br>During its 3rd Commencement Exercises, the school graduated its first Valedictorian, Janice D.G. Roman, member of the Grade School Class 2005.<br><br>In April 2016, the school name has been changed from St. John the Baptist Academy of Manila to St. John Academy of Manila Foundation Inc.<br><br>In 2014, the first known FAPE, now PEAC granted the school its first certification. Further, the school has its second recertification in 2016 and will be undergoing third certification for this school year 2020-2021.<br><br>April 2018, Mr. Lising passed away and his position was passed on to her sister Mrs. Teresita Dayoja, who is the president of the school.</p>
